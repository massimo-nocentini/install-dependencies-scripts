# The following line has been adapted from:

# the following command isn't really necessary, since the output says":
# "IPython.external.mathjax is deprecated, Mathjax is now installed by default with the notebook package"
# $ sudo python3.5 -m IPython.external.mathjax ~/Developer/snapshots/mathjax/MathJax-2.6.1.tar.gz
