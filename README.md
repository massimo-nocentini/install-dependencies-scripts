# Install dependencies scripts
This repository contains bash scripts to install required dependencies of packages I work with.

In this repository we collect scripts that allows us to reproduce a working linux box with
tools we need to study and doing our work.

There's a *Makefile* also, with a rule that encodes the order in which installations and
compilings have to be done.
