# in order to install `leiningen`, the tooling for clojure project development,
# it is sufficient to get `lein` script at:
# https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technomancy/leiningen/stable/bin/lein
# all clojure stuff then pass through it.

# moreover its dependencies, namely jdk, are already satisfied at this point of our
# main script.
