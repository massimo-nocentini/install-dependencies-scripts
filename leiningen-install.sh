# in order to install `leiningen`, the tooling for clojure project development,
# it is sufficient to get `lein` script at:
# https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technomancy/leiningen/stable/bin/lein
# all clojure stuff then pass through it. Then make it executable (on the github page
# there's a complete step by step description however), then add the directory
# within our Developer/snapshot tree to the PATH system variable.

# moreover its dependencies, namely jdk, are already satisfied at this point of our
# main script.
